## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

I’ve learned some subtle nuances about how Next.js handles images, particularly regarding image loading. For example, even if there are two images depending on the device or screen size, Next.js only loads the necessary one (which can be seen in the network requests). Therefore, there’s no need to implement complex systems to optimize image loading or prevent unnecessary image downloads.
